So far, the most helpful video I've watched was the one involving logic laws, during the second week of class. While it is an early example, covering the basics of logical equivalences in propositional logic, I had gone from knowing almost nothing about the subject to being able to solve them myself through the video. I think the video is an excellent supplement to the main course material due to this.
